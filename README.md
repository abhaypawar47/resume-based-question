## ‚úÖ React.js (15 Questions)

1.  **What are React components?**
    Components are reusable UI pieces. Function components use hooks; class components have state and lifecycle methods.

2.  **What‚Äôs JSX?**
    A syntax extension mixing HTML-like tags with JavaScript, compiled by Babel into `React.createElement` calls.

3.  **Function vs class components?**
    Function components are simpler, use hooks; class components are stateful and include lifecycle methods.

4.  **What are hooks?**
    Functions like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext` that enable state and lifecycle-like features in functional components.

5.  **Explain `useState`.**
    Hook to add state in functions. Returns current state and setter:
    ```js
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    ```

6.  **Explain `useEffect`.**
    Performs side effects (fetching, subscriptions). Can mimic mount/update/unmount with dependency array.

7.  **What‚Äôs virtual DOM?**
    A lightweight in-memory tree React uses to diff and efficiently update the real DOM.

8.  **Keys in lists‚Äîwhy?**
    Helps React track items. Unique keys prevent unnecessary re-renders and maintain identity.

9.  **Prop drilling & alternatives.**
    Passing props deeply. Alternatives: Context API, Redux, or component composition.

10. **What are React fragments?**
    `<React.Fragment>` or `<>...</>` groups multiple children without adding extra DOM nodes.

11. **Controlled vs uncontrolled components?**
    Controlled: React state drives inputs. Uncontrolled: DOM ref holds value; React reads via ref.

12. **Error boundaries?**
    Class components with `componentDidCatch` catch runtime errors in child components to prevent whole app crash.

13. **HOC vs render props?**
    HOC is a function wrapping a component. Render prop is a component accepting a function that returns JSX.

14. **React Context use-case?**
    Avoids prop drilling; useful for themes, locales, auth, global stores.

15. **What‚Äôs Suspense?**
    For code splitting and async rendering; works with `React.lazy` to load components lazily.

4.  **Difference between `.class1 .class2` and `.class1.class2`?**
    `.class1 .class2`: descendant. `.class1.class2`: same element must have both classes.

5.  **What‚Äôs BEM methodology?**
    Naming convention: `block__element--modifier` for scalable, maintainable CSS.

6.  **Explain `:nth-child`.**
    Selects elements based on position, e.g. `li:nth-child(odd)`.

7.  **How does `position: sticky` work?**
    Acts like relative until a threshold; then sticks as if fixed within its parent.

8.  **What‚Äôs CSS Grid `fr` unit?**
    Fractional unit dividing available space.

9.  **Explain CSS transitions vs animations.**
    Transitions animate between states on change. Animations are fully scripted keyframe-based movements.

    Context depends on invocation: method, function, arrow, or `bind`, `call`, `apply`.

7.  **How does `async`/`await` work?**
    Syntax sugar over promises; `await` pauses until a promise resolves.

8.  **What‚Äôs event loop?**
    JS runtime mechanism handling asynchronous callbacks from the task queue after the call stack clears.

9.  **Explain array methods: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`.**
    * `map`: transforms elements.
    * `filter`: selects elements.
    * `reduce`: accumulates into a single value.

10. **Spread vs rest syntax?**
    * Spread (`...`): decompresses arrays/objects into individual elements/properties.
    * Rest (`...`): collects remaining elements into an array or object.

11. **What‚Äôs a module in JS?**
    `import`/`export` allows encapsulation and reuse of code across files.

12. **How to deep-clone an object?**
    Use `structuredClone()`, `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...))`, or libraries like Lodash's `cloneDeep`.

13. **Explain debouncing vs throttling.**
    * **Debounce:** wait after the *last* event in a series before executing (e.g., search input).
    * **Throttle:** fire at most every `N` milliseconds, even if events are continuous (e.g., scroll, resize).

### üîÄ Git (8 Questions)

1.  **What is Git?** Git is a distributed version control system used to track code changes, enable collaboration, and manage project history.

2.  **Difference between Git and GitHub?** * **Git:** A version control system (local tool) that tracks changes in source code.
    * **GitHub:** A web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories, facilitating collaboration and project management.

3.  **What does `git clone` do?** Copies a remote repository to your local system, including all version history.  
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/user/repo.git](https://github.com/user/repo.git)
    ```

4.  **What is `git commit` vs `git push`?**
    * **`git commit`:** Saves your staged changes to your local repository's history.
    * **`git push`:** Sends your committed changes from your local repository to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub).

5.  **How to undo a commit?**
    * **`git revert <commit-hash>`:** Creates a new commit that undoes the changes of a previous commit (safe for shared history).
    * **`git reset --hard <commit-hash>`:** Moves the branch pointer to a previous commit and discards all subsequent changes (destructive, use with caution on shared branches).

6.  **What is a Git branch?**
    A branch is a lightweight, movable pointer to a commit. It represents a separate line of development, allowing you to work on new features or bug fixes independently without affecting the main codebase.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/login # Creates and switches to a new branch
    ```

7.  **What is the purpose of `.gitignore`?**
    A `.gitignore` file specifies intentionally untracked files and directories that Git should ignore. This is crucial for preventing unnecessary files (e.g., build artifacts, `node_modules/`, `.env` files, IDE configurations) from being committed to the repository.

8.  **How do you resolve merge conflicts?**
    Merge conflicts occur when Git cannot automatically reconcile differences between two branches being merged. To resolve:
    1.  Git will mark the conflicting sections in the files.
    2.  Manually edit the conflicting files to choose which changes to keep.
    3.  Stage the resolved files: `git add .`
    4.  Commit the resolution: `git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"`

### üåê GitHub (6 Questions)

1.  **What is GitHub used for?**
    GitHub is primarily used for:
    * Hosting Git repositories.
    * Collaborative code development via pull requests and code reviews.
    * Issue tracking and project management.
    * Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions.
    * Project documentation (Wikis, READMEs).
    * Community building for open-source projects.

2.  **What is a pull request (PR)?**
    A Pull Request (PR) is a feature on GitHub (and similar platforms) that allows developers to notify team members about changes they've pushed to a branch in a repository. It's a formal request to merge your changes from one branch (e.g., a feature branch) into another (e.g., `main`), enabling code review, discussions, and automated checks before merging.

3.  **How do GitHub forks work?**
    Forking creates a personal copy of a repository under your GitHub account. This allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original (upstream) repository. You can then make changes in your forked repository and later propose these changes back to the original repository via a pull request.

4.  **What is GitHub Actions?**
    GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) platform directly integrated into GitHub. It allows you to automate workflows to build, test, and deploy your code directly from your repository. You define workflows in YAML files (`.github/workflows/`), which can be triggered by various events like pushes, pull requests, or scheduled times.

5.  **How to secure a GitHub repository?**
    * **Branch Protection Rules:** Prevent direct pushes to sensitive branches (e.g., `main`), require pull request reviews, status checks, and linear history.
    * **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Enable 2FA for all collaborators to add an extra layer of security.
    * **`.gitignore` and Secret Scanning:** Use `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive files from being committed. Enable GitHub's secret scanning to detect exposed secrets.
    * **Manage Collaborators and Permissions:** Regularly review and restrict access to the minimum necessary permissions for each user or team.
    * **Audit Logs:** Monitor audit logs for unusual activity.

6.  **How to contribute to open source?**
    1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create a copy of the project under your GitHub account.
    2.  **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
    3.  **Create a New Branch:** Make a new branch for your specific feature or bug fix (`git checkout -b your-feature-branch`).
    4.  **Make Changes:** Implement your code changes.
    5.  **Commit and Push:** Commit your changes to your branch and push them to your forked repository on GitHub.
    6.  **Open a Pull Request:** Go to the original (upstream) repository on GitHub and open a pull request from your branch to their `main` or `development` branch, explaining your changes.

2.  **Which languages does Jupyter support?**
    Jupyter Notebook is language-agnostic. While it's most commonly used with **Python** (via the IPython kernel), it supports over 40 programming languages, including R, Julia, Scala, and many others, through the concept of "kernels."

3.  **What are the components of a Jupyter Notebook?**
    A Jupyter Notebook document (`.ipynb` file) consists of:
    * **Cells:** The basic units of a notebook.
        * **Code Cells:** Contain executable code (e.g., Python, R).
        * **Markdown Cells:** Contain text formatted using Markdown, often for explanations, titles, or comments.
        * **Raw Cells:** Contain text that is not rendered by the notebook.
    * **Kernel:** The computational engine that runs the code in the cells.
    * **Output:** The results generated by executing code cells (e.g., text, tables, plots, error messages).

4.  **How to install and run Jupyter Notebook?**
    You can install Jupyter Notebook using pip (Python's package installer):
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```
    To run it, open your terminal or command prompt in your desired project directory and type:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This will open a new tab in your web browser with the Jupyter Notebook interface.

5.  **What is a kernel in Jupyter?**
    A kernel in Jupyter is a separate process that runs and interprets the code executed within a Jupyter Notebook. When you run a code cell, the request is sent to the kernel, which executes the code and sends the results back to the notebook interface. For Python, the default kernel is IPython.

6.  **How to export a notebook?**
    Jupyter Notebooks can be exported to various formats via the `File > Download as` menu option. Common export formats include:
    * `.ipynb` (the native notebook format)
    * `.py` (Python script)
    * `.html` (HTML web page)
    * `.pdf` (PDF document, often requiring LaTeX installation)
    * `.md` (Markdown)

7.  **How to display plots in Jupyter?**
    To display plots inline within a Jupyter Notebook, you typically use plotting libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn. You'll often include a "magic command" at the beginning of your notebook:
    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    # Or for Seaborn: import seaborn as sns

    %matplotlib inline 
    # This magic command ensures that plots are displayed directly in the notebook output.

    # Your plotting code here
    plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
    plt.show()
    ```

8.  **What are Jupyter magic commands?**
    Jupyter magic commands are special commands (not part of Python syntax) that extend the capabilities of the IPython kernel. They start with `%` (line magics, affecting a single line) or `%%` (cell magics, affecting the entire cell). They are used for tasks like timing code, running external scripts, interacting with the system shell, and configuring the notebook environment.
    * **Examples:**
        * `%timeit`: Measures the execution time of a single line of code.
        * `%%time`: Measures the execution time of the entire cell.
        * `%ls`: Lists files in the current directory (like `ls` in bash).
        * `%run script.py`: Executes a Python script.
        * `%%writefile my_script.py`: Writes the content of the cell to a file.
